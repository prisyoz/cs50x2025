# cs50x2025 Projects

This repository contains my assignments to the CS50x - Introduction to Computer Science course assignments. It covers various topics in CS, including algorithms, data structures and web development.

## Programming languages:
- C

## Problem Sets

### Problem Set 0: Scratch
Create a simple game (maze) using Scratch using conditional statements, variables, loop etc

### Problem Set 1: C
- /me: printed "Hello World"
- /mario-less: created a Mario-like pyramid
- /cash: implemented a change system which will show the least amount of coins needed with greedy algorithm (in US dollar)

- /credit: implemented credit card validation using Luhn algorithm


### Problem Set 2: Arrays and Functions
- /scrabble: calculated points in Scrabble using arrays and loops.
- /readability: evaluated reading grades of texts (Flesch-Kincaid score) using functions.
- /caesar: encrypted messages using caesar cipher by shifting each letter by some number of places given by user.
- /substitution: encrypted messages using a substitution cipher with an alphabetic key given by user.

### Problem Set 3: Algorithms
- /sort: recognised three sorting algorithms based on their running times.
- /plurality: completed a program to manage a vote with plurality system.
- /runoff: completed a program that uses ranked-choice voting system to handle ties.

### Problem Set 4: Memory
- /volume: copied an audio file (.WAV) modifying its volume by a factor given by user.
- /filter-more: applied filters to bitmap images: grayscale, reflect, blur and edges (I chose this difficult version because edges filter is related to AI).
- /recover: recover JPEGs files from the forensic image of a memory card.
